To zero-rate any website, a mobile operator would need to make sure that all network traffic that an end user generates is on a single top level domain.

This is not straight forward, and it's the bulk of the work you'd need to do if you wanted to zero-rate your website.

To understand what would be involved, go to your website in your browser, have developer tools open and look through all of the network requests that are generated by browsing around.

In order for your site to be zero-rated *every single one of these requests must change to be via your top level domain*.
