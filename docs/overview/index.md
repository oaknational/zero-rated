## A guide to zero-rating a website

Zero-rating is the process by which a mobile phone operator (MNO) can make a rule across their network that when one of their customers visits a particular website, the data that is transferred is not charged. The cost of the data is "rated" as being "zero".

This site documents the approach that we took at [Oak National Academy](https://thenational.academy) to make changes to our website so that it was possible for all UK MNOs to zero-rate our services.

Using the documentation we've provided here, you could work on your own zero-rating efforts.

The approaches we cover here have additional benefits:

* By moving all of your requests onto your own domain, you can reduce the impact of ad-blockers and potentially improve user experience for users who use them
* You are in control of all of the traffic generated by visits to your site
* You may be able to improve the performance of third party scripts or replace them with a better experience
