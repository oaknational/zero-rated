## A guide to zero-rating a website

Zero-rating is the process by which a mobile phone operator (MNO) can make a rule across their network that when one of their customers visits a particular website, the data that is transferred is not charged. The cost of the data is "rated" as being "zero".

This site documents the approach that we took at Oak National Academy to make changes to our website so that it was possible for all UK MNOs to zero-rate our services.
