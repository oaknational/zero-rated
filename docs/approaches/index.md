In this section, you can find the various approaches that we took to zero-rating the content on the Oak National Academy website.

Documented here are the various approaches we took once [we had audited which third-party scripts and services we had on our webite](/docs/audit).

This section includes notes on the following approaches:
* [Removing third party scripts](/docs/approaches/removal)
* [Changing cookie consent provider](/docs/approaches/cookies)
* [Adding first-party analytics](/docs/approaches/first-party-analytics)
* [Changing video provider](/docs/approaches/video)
* [Proxying requests via Cloudflare workers](/docs/approaches/proxying)
* [Rebuilding components](/docs/approaches/rebuild-third-party-tools)
* [Self-hosting fonts and scripts](/docs/approaches/self-host-fonts-and-scripts)
* [Self-hosting images from third parties](/docs/approaches/self-host-images)
* [Choosing self-hosted alternatives](/docs/approaches/self-hosted-alternatives)
* [Using an image-resizing service](/docs/approaches/use-an-image-resizing-service)
* [Working with Google docs and slides](/docs/approaches/google-docs-and-sheets)

We welcome contributions for other approaches which could appear here. To contribute a new approach, [fork this respository and make a pull request on Github](https://github.com/oaknational/zero-rating).
