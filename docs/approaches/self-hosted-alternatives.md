If you find that there is a service you are using which looks particularly challenging to zero-rate, then you should consider looking for a self-hosted alternative. There are many open source alternatives to common services, and you might find that if you research the type of tool you are using that there is one available to replace it.

However, migrating all of your content over from one tool to another may prove prohibitively expensive.
